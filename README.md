# Shopping

A sample shopping cart implemented using SwiftUI and MVVM.

Swift UI is chosen as its highly recommended by Apple and its cross platform (same UI can be used on Apple Watch and Apple TV etc)

MVVM is a design pattern helpful to keep UI rendering and interaction code separated to business logic. Keeping business logic separate helps in better maintainability, readability and scalability of code
